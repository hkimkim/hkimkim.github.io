      Hi, I am Heekyung. 
    </p>

    <p class="post">
      I am a <b>masters student of computer science</b> at Northeastern University in Boston, MA.
    </p>

    <p class="post">
      Prior to joining the masters program, I was a business management major with strong interests in technology and programming.
       The interest of the two led me to pursue data analyst internships at a NLP startup and pharmaceutical company, as well as a reseach assisstant role at a Corporate Venture Capital. 
       At these roles, I used programming as a tool to analyze various types of data (text, voice, patient number.. etc) and as my creative outlet to solve daily tasks.
       While I enjoyed using programming as a tool to analyze data and understand business, I realized that I wanted to use programming to build products and services, which led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science.
    </p>

    <p class="post">
      My current interests are in XR and my current goal is to find a co-op or an internship where I can gain real-life experience in software-engineering,
       which can help me build a career in the tech industry.
    </p>
